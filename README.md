# Easy-Life-Chatbot

I created a chatbot using Google's DIalogFlow and Flask in python.

The chatbot was hosted on telegram under the username @PushpakRuhilBot

## Features
- Can have small talks
- Can convert currencies.
- Can ask the chatbot to search and scrape results from google
- Can ask for the current weather in a particular city.
